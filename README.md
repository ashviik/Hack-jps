We used open source tutorials for our code. We edited it for our needs and we incorporated snake game to improve the code.

We were unable to incorporate the snake game into the webpage with the timer in the allotted time. 
We were able to convert our game from python to javascript, allowing us to deploy it quickly. But we did not have enough time to add the game into the page. 
Our timer is fully working and stable.
